# Finite-Difference-Method using C++

## Overview
The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to differential equations. This project showcases the implementation of the Finite Difference Method in C++, focusing on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) through discretization and iterative calculations.

## Technical Details
The project involves discretizing the PDE using finite differences, which breaks down the continuous equation into a set of algebraic equations. The solver iteratively computes values at each grid point based on neighboring values, taking into account boundary conditions.
